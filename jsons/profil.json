	"abstract": "The OMeGA team is affiliated with the IRIMAS Institute at the Université de Haute-Alsace, Mulhouse. The team’s research activities are primarily devoted to artificial intelligence, optimization, metaheuristics, and the algorithmic processing of visual and geometric data. A particular focus is placed on the development of advanced methodologies for addressing complex computational and applied problems. The scope of our work encompasses artificial intelligence, operations research, single- and multi-objective optimization, as well as data-driven optimization, with contributions spanning both theoretical foundations and practical applications. <br> The team specializes in developing innovative algorithms for real-world applications, including materials science, energy, logistics, computer vision, and sustainable and biomedical imaging systems. We combine expertise in evolutionary computation, machine learning, and hybrid optimization techniques to tackle problems where traditional methods reach their limits. ",
